\section{Conclusion}
%TODO: how to start?
In summary, we have explained our methodology and introduced guide lines on how to annotate sentences. We have collected and annotated over 9000 sentences from the comment section of political articles on Danish social media. We have introduced several implementations that predicts sentiment and the most promosing being our SVM. We discovered that Facebook largely consisted of negative sentences, and that it seems negative and neutral sentences are very much alike and therefore harder to distinguish. We have also discovered that with an increasingly larger dataset, we would be able to achieve a higher accuracy. Looking forward, we believe we should increase our dataset and continuiously try different variations of the SVM that we did not get to introduce in this paper.
