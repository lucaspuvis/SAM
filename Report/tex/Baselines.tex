\subsection{Primitive Classifiers}
For statistical purposes we have implemented two primitive classifiers, one called Baseline Classifier and one called Random Classifier. These are implemented to ensure that our more advanced classifiers are better at determining sentiment than randomly guessing or simply choosing the most frequent sentiment.

\subsubsection{Baseline Classifier}
The purpose of the baseline classifier is to guess for the sentiment which appears most frequently in the dataset, which in our case is neutral. Since the baseline classifier statically guesses for the sentiment which appears most frequently, the accuracy will always be equivalent to the amount of that specific class within the dataset. In our case, this means we hit 45.37\% with the results seen in figure \ref{blresult}.

		Actual & & Negative & Neutral & Positive &  \\ \midrule
		Negative & & 0 & 3472 & 0 & \\
		Neutral  & & 0 & 4087 & 0 & \\
		Positive & & 0 & 1449 & 0 & \\ \bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\centering

\end{table}
\subsubsection{Random Classifier}
The purpose of the random classifier is to guess randomly for a sentiment. The random classifier will guess randomly between the three options, and averages to around 33.33\% accuracy, since it has 1/3 chance of correctly guessing the sentiment. Given in figure \ref{randresult} are the results of running the random classifier on our dataset, which in this case resulted in an accuracy of 33.09\%.

	\begin{tabular}{@{}llllll@{}}
		\toprule
		& & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Predicted} \\\cmidrule{3-5}
		Actual & & Negative & Neutral & Positive &  \\ \midrule
		Negative & & 1167 & 1164 & 1141 & \\
		Neutral  & & 1375 & 1361 & 1351 & \\
		Positive & & 530 & 466 & 453 & \\ \bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
